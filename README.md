This project is a UI that routes requests to a Currency Exchange Rate API. I made this app in order to demonstrate the skills I've learned in CSS/SCSS, Bootstrap, HTML, EJS, jQuery, axios, Node, Express, JavaScript, and Webpack.

Run npm install, followed by npm run start to use this application. Use npm run analyze to see a visual
representation of output files.
